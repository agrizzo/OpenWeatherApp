# Weather App

## Installation and Running
App has been tested on
 
 * iPhone 8 Plus
 * iPhone SE
 

## Future Enhancements

### UI
The entire UI can be redesigned. This was merely a proof of concept with what was given from the API feed.

There are also readily available icons corresponding to the weather description usability improvements

### Personalization:

 * Choose a location. It is currently for one hard coded location.
 * Additional Locations
 * Units of Measure. Metric and Scientific are easily available
 * Multi-lingual. Other languages are readily available through the data feed

### Technology

* Multi-environment design: Production, Development, Beta

### Technical Debt
* Code coverage is not 100%. The last part of the app (the UICollectionViewDataSource), was not fully tested.
* There seems to be an issue with with the initial load from the API. The observing technology needs to be revisited. While it passed unit testing, there is something amiss
